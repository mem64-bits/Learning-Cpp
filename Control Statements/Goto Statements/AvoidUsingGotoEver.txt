The primary problem with goto is that it allows a programmer to 
jump around the code arbitrarily. This creates what is
known as spaghetti code. 

Spaghetti code is code that has a path of execution that 
resembles a bowl of spaghetti (all tangled and twisted), 
making it extremely difficult to follow the logic of such code.
