 If your program is exhibiting erroneous behavior, one way to reduce the amount of code you have to search through is to comment some code out and see if the issue persists. If the issue remains unchanged, the commented out code probably wasnâ€™t responsible.

Consider the following code:

int main()
{
    getNames(); // ask user to enter a bunch of names
    doMaintenance(); // do some random stuff
    sortNames(); // sort them in alphabetical order
    printNames(); // print the sorted list of names

    return 0;
}
