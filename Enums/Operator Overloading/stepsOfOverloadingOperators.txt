Similarly, C++ also supports operator overloading, 
which lets us define overloads of existing operators, 
so that we can make those operators work with our 
program-defined data types.

Basic operator overloading is fairly straightforward:

    1. Define a function using the name of the operator as the functionâ€™s name.

    2. Add a parameter of the appropriate type for each operand (in left-to-right order). 
    
    3. One of these parameters must be a user-defined type (a class type or an enumerated type), 
       otherwise the compiler will error.

    4. Set the return type to whatever type makes sense.

    5. Use a return statement to return the result of the operation.
